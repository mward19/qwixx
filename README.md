# Goal
I'm implementing Qwixx with a terminal interface, and later a web interface. I hope that I can use statistics to make a bot that will win the game as often as possible. If I can't, hopefully I'll learn something in the process.

Until then, to run the game as it is, run src/qwixx_term.py with `python [path to qwixx_term.py]`.
