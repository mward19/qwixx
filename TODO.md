## Highest priority
Implement proper turn structure (everyone can use the white roll)


# Turn structure
- Player 1 rolls
- Display/highlight possibilities, separated by white options and color options
- Let other players decide if/where they want the white roll
- Let Player 1 decide if/where they want the white roll
- Let Player 1 decide if/where they want the color roll
- End turn, display board
